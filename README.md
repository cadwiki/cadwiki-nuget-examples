# cadwiki nuget examples
A collection of sample projects and solutions to demonstrate how to use cadwiki nuget packages

## App.sln  
This is a AutoCAD IExtensionApplication written in vb.net.  
It demonstates how to use the cadwiki.DllReloader to easily reload itself into a AutoCAD's current Application Domain.  
The cadwiki.DllReloader makes seeing code changes in AutoCAD faster since you won't have to close and restart for each new dll build.  

### Before Building
Repath the interop references on the AcadInterop2021 project

Autodesk.AutoCAD.Interop
Autodesk.AutoCAD.Interop.Common

This is probably where they are on standard installations of AutoCAD.
If you installed to a custom drive (example 'E:\' instead of 'C:\') then repath to the custom path instead
C:\Program Files\Autodesk\AutoCAD 2021\Autodesk.AutoCAD.Interop.dll
C:\Program Files\Autodesk\AutoCAD 2021\Autodesk.AutoCAD.Interop.Common.dll

### Build steps
Click Build -> Rebuild solution in Visual Studio

During the build, the .vbproj files will:
1. update all AssemblyInfo.vb files based on the buildThisFirst projects mblyInfo.vb file
1. create all .dlls
1. copy all .dlls into the .\MainApp\bin\v_#.#.#.# folder that corresponds to the current build number.  
1. create a bootload.scr file for netloading the new .dll into AutoCAD

Always set build platform to x64 for .dlls that will be loaded into AutoCAD

### Automated Debug steps

Click Build -> Rebuild solution in Visual Studio.  
This is done to ensure all the .dll's are ready for the CadDevTools project.

The box will be populated with a few locations of AutoCAD.  
Choose an existing location or 'Browse' to a new location.
Click Green Okay.

AutoCAD will launch.  
![NotFound](./App/screenshots/automated-debug-7-CadDevTools-AutoCAD-Launch.png)    

This will load the most recently built .dll in the _v subfolder of the current .exe's bin folder.  
AutoCAD will start and netload the dll for you.

### How to reload a .dll  
Make sure AutoCAD is running with the dll netloaded.  
Close CADDevTools UserInterface if it's open.

Detach Visual Studio.  
![NotFound](./App/screenshots/autocad-reload-a-dll-2-deatch-all.png)

Rebuild MainApp project.  
![NotFound](./App/screenshots/autocad-reload-a-dll-3-rebuild-MainApp.png)  

In AutoCAD, Click 'Reload Count:#'  
![NotFound](./App/screenshots/autocad-reload-a-dll-4-click-ReloadCount.png)    

The dll will be Reloaded with your new changes

### Manual Debug steps
Set startup project as MainApp
Goto MainApp->Properties->Debug

Set Startup program:
C:\Program Files\Autodesk\AutoCAD 2021\acad.exe

Set Command line arguments to the bootload.scr created from the build process:
/b "C:\..someWhere...\pathToRepoRoot\bootload.scr"

Click Green Start button on top middle menu of Visual Studio
